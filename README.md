Many small businesses still use paper-based system for data management. But relying on physical paper document has a lot of complications. There is tremendous ‘Piled up paperwork and lost files’ involved in it. It is not only time consuming to search in such files, but also extremely unsafe. One cannot monitor authorised access to the data. 
So, the main objective of this project is to overcome all such issues and provide a convenient and safer alternative for data management.

NOTE: "user details.txt" file stores details of mess users.
